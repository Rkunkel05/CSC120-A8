Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
**DETAILED DESCRIPTION + WHAT IT DOES**
When reading through the list of actions, I thought of them as all being something a human might do, so I created a "Person" class to complete all of them. Thus, the person is able to fly, change in size, pick up/drop objects, and more. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
* land()
* Various getters (getX, getY, getMoving, etc.)
* Item.java


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
* Starting off with breaking everything down and creating a very basic foundation
* Building on top of that foundation
* Taking breaks instead of tackling it all in one sitting!
